# Date-Fixer
This code was written to correct date column data from a list of SQL insert commands. It re-writes the corrected commands to an SQL script that I then used to add data to my database. This code can be re-purposed to edit your own generated SQL commands. Enjoy and create an issue if you need any assistance re-purposing.
